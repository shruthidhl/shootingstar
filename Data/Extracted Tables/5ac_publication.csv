12,12,"I presented this paper in 2018 2nd IEEE International Conference on Power Electronics, Intelligent Control and Energy Systems (ICPEICES) held in Delhi Technological University in October 2018Abstract:A major chunk of losses in electrical power systems is constituted by losses incurred due to poor power factor. A plethora of ways have been implemented to deal with this problem for quite a long time now. The intention behind this paper was to address to this woe which may be used for correction of power factor in various power systems. Employment of Automatic Power Factor Correction panels or more commonly known as APFC panels in electrical distribution networks is gaining prominence owing to the superiority of APFC panels over fixed capacitor banks in maintaining the desired power factor with different loads therefore, improving overall efficiency of the power system. A power factor correction unit enables the system to attain power factor values close to unity for efficient operation. The merits of higher power factor values include increased efficiency, load carrying capacity, better voltage regulation etcetera. The APFC panel was implemented on various loads operating together three phase Induction motor connected in parallel to series combination of a variable resistive and variable inductive load. In accordance to the instantaneous recorded value of power factor, the apposite capacitors are injected into the circuit to improve the power factor values. Improvised instantaneous values of the power factor were observed.",Power Factor Correction Using APFC Panel on Different Loads,"{'day': 1, 'month': 10, 'year': 2018}",IEEE,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8897359/metrics#metrics

14,14,"The problem of learning partial differential equations (PDEs) from given data is investigated here. Several algorithms have been developed for PDE learning from accurate data sets. These include using sparse optimization for approximating the coefficients of candidate terms in a general PDE model. In this work, the study is extended to spatiotemporal data sets with various noise levels. We compare the performance of conventional and novel methods for denoising the data. Different architectures of neural networks are used to denoise data and approximate derivatives. These methods are numerically tested on the linear convection-diffusion equation and the nonlinear convection-diffusion equation (Burgers' equation). Results suggest that modification in the hidden units/hidden layers in the network architecture have an effect on the accuracy of approximations with a significant rate. This is a further improvement on the previously known denoising methods of finite differences, polynomial regression splines and single layer neural network.",Learning Partial Differential Equations from Noisy Data using Neural Networks,"{'day': 5, 'month': 11, 'year': 2020}",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088%2F1742-6596%2F1655%2F1%2F012075

Generally the web contains bulk of raw data and the process of converting this data to information mining process can be performed. At whatever point the user places some inquiry on particular web search tool, outcomes are produced with respect to the requests which are dependent on the magnitude of the document created via web information retrieval tools. The results are obtained using calculations and implementation of well written algorithms. Well known web search tools like Google and other varied engines contain their specific manner to compute the page rank, various outcomes are obtained on various web crawlers for a same inquiry because the method for deciding the importance of the sites contrasts among number of algorithm. In this research, an attempt to analyze well-known page ranking calculation on the basis of their quality and shortcomings.

70,63,"ABSTRACTThis paper addresses the issues of energy hole and coverage hole in wireless sensor network. The coverage hole refers to areas in a sensor field inaccessible by any of the deployed sensor nodes. A node deployment strategy is proposed so that it is ensured that all points in the network field are covered by at least one sensor and it also targets to provide alpha coverage for the network. The energy hole is created due to load imbalance among sensor nodes as sensors that are closer to the sink dissipate their energy faster due to the additional burden of transmitting data from other sensors collected via multi-hop. Thus, sensor nodes near the sink die faster creating an energy-hole and eventually reducing network lifetime. This paper proposes a sink mobility pattern that ensures load balancing by covering the entire field spending equal time in equal areas of the field and avoids the problem of energy hole by reducing energy consumption and extending network lifetime.",Avoiding Coverage Holes and Energy Holes using Mobile Sink in Wireless Sensor Network,"{'day': 16, 'month': 2, 'year': 2017}","ICEIT Conference on Advances in Mobile Communications, Networking and Computing",http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ynsingh/MCNC2017/MCNC2017.pdf
